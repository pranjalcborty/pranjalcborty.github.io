                    <h2>About me</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am currently doing my Masters in Computer Science at Brock University and working as a graduate 
                        teaching and research assistant as well. My research is broadly in the software engineering domain, 
                        under supervision of <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/naser-ezzati-71418724" target="_blank">Dr. Naser Ezzati-Jivan</a>.
                        I had worked as a software engineer for <a href="https://www.therapservices.net/" target="_blank">Therap</a> for more than 
                        four years. I was involved in developing and maintaining modules, using frameworks like Spring and JPA (Hibernate). 
                        Alongside, I have worked with Node.js to prototype webapps and build chatbots. I have proficiency in building 
                        systems using Machine Learning and Deep Learning, especially to forecast capital market movement and to process 
                        natural language, which also helped me to enhance my knowledge in Python and various popular ML/DL frameworks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Apart from these, I like to spend my time outdoors, mostly. Although taking a stroll is a luxury for a graduate student,
                        I try to take a break and roam around the beautiful garden city St. Catharines and the Niagara region in general.
                        I love fishing, which I have forgotten when I did for the last time. I think I'll get myself a fishing licence very soon!

                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>
                        I completed my Bachelor's from BRAC University in Computer Science and Engineering and did my
                        Master's from the same place in Applied Economics. I was one of the student tutors of
                        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hammad-ali-7a88915/"
                            target="_blank">Abu Mohammad Hammad Ali</a>,
                        to assist him grading scripts and helping students regarding the course Discrete Mathematics.
                        My undergraduate thesis supervisor was
                        <a href="https://www.bracu.ac.bd/about/people/mahbubul-alam-majumdar-phd" target="_blank">
                            Professor Mahbub Alam Majumdar</a>.
                        The Master's thesis of mine was done under supervision of
                        <a href="https://www.bracu.ac.bd/about/people/wasiqur-rahman-khan-phd" target="_blank">
                            Professor Wasiqur Rahman Khan</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At Brock, I am working as a Teaching Assistant for the course Introduction to Computer Architecture, 
                        to help undergrad students with the subject. In my undergrad life, I was actively involved in different 
                        co-curricular activities. I was the campus lead of Firefox Club (currently Mozilla Club) in BRAC University. 
                        I was also a university appointed Student Mentor for the freshers. Apart from that, from almost the beginning of my
                        university life, I was whole heartedly involved with BRAC University Computer Club, to organize
                        tech events, workshops on-campus.
