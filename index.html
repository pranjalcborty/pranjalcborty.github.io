            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p class="justify">
                I am currently finishing up my Masters in Computer Science at Brock University and working as a graduate 
                teaching and research assistant. My research tries to solve memory related issues in resource constrained systems, 
                under the supervision of <a href="https://naser.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Naser Ezzati-Jivan</a>.
                Before my masters journey, I had worked as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.therapservices.net/" 
                target="_blank">Therap</a> for more than four years, where I was involved in developing and maintaining modules for an 
                enterprise web application.
