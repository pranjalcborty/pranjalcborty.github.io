                    <h2>About me</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am a software engineer; working for Therap for more than two years now. Therap is one of the 
                        most used online SaaS platform, which provides documentation and reporting services to the agencies, 
                        that work with people with developmental disabilities. I am involved in developing and maintaining 
                        modules, using frameworks like Spring and JPA (Hibernate). Alongside, I like to work with Nodejs
                        to prototype webapps and build chatbot servers. I have a moderate experience with Machine
                        Learning
                        and Deep Learning, to forecast capital market movement and to process natural language, which 
                        also helped me to enhance my knowledge in Python and various popular ML/DL frameworks.

                        Apart from my this part of life, I like to spend my time outdoors, mostly. I often take long walks 
                        through the roads and lanes of Gulshan-Banani, eat whatever I find edible and buy unneccessary things. 
                        I love fishing, which I have forgotten when I did for the last time. For my undergraduate study, I left my 
                        hometown Chittagong about 6 years ago. Since then I am suffering from homesickness. Life gave me as 
                        much as it took away. It is basically a zero-sum game.
