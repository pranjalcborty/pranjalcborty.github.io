                    <h2>About me</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am working for Therap for more than two years now. Therap provides documentation and reporting
                        services to the agencies,
                        that work with people with developmental disabilities. I am involved in developing and
                        maintaining
                        modules, using frameworks like Spring and JPA (Hibernate). Alongside, I like to work with Nodejs
                        to prototype webapps and build chatbots. I have a moderate experience with Machine
                        Learning
                        and Deep Learning, to forecast capital market movement and to process natural language, which
                        also helped me to enhance my knowledge in Python and various popular ML/DL frameworks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Apart from these, I like to spend my time outdoors, mostly. I often take long walks
                        through the roads and lanes of Gulshan-Banani, eat whatever I find edible and buy unneccessary
                        things.
                        I love fishing, which I have forgotten when I did for the last time 
                        (you will understand if you've ever been in Dhaka).

                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>
                        I completed my Bachelor's from BRAC University in Computer Science and Engineering and did my
                        Master's from
                        the same place in Applied Economics. I was one of the student tutors of

                        to assist him
                        grading scripts and helping students regarding the course Discrete Mathematics.
                        My undergraduate thesis supervisor was
                        <a href="https://www.bracu.ac.bd/about/people/mahbubul-alam-majumdar-phd" target="_blank">Dr.
                            Mahbub Alam Majumdar</a> (current Chairperson of Computer Science and Engineering department).
                        The Master's thesis of mine was
                        done under supervision of
                        <a href="https://www.bracu.ac.bd/about/people/wasiqur-rahman-khan-phd" target="_blank">Dr.

                    <p>
                        In my university life, I was actively involved in different co-curricular activities. I was the
                        campus lead of Firefox Club (currently Mozilla Club) in BRAC University. I was also a university
                        appointed Student Mentor for the freshers. Apart from that, from almost the beginning of my
                        university life, I was whole heartedly involved with BRAC University Computer Club, to organize
                        tech events, workshops on-campus.
